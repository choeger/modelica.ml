Modelica abstract syntax and parser
Modelica abstract syntax and parser Modelica.ml is a Modelica frontend
implemented in OCaml. It is written with compilation in mind, but
should also be useful for other applications. Modelica.ml currently
supports, abstract syntax, parsing, pretty printing and a form of
lookup analysis (class normalization). Patches welcome!
