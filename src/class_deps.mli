(** A kontext label (kontext means a type-with-a-hole 
    and needs to be distinguished from the context used 
    during evaluation) is a basically a pointer to a 
    place in a type-tree, where a path needs to be looked up.
    In theory, there are multiple 𝛴-entries possible, but for
    implementation purposes it shouldn't matter in which order they
    are evaluated (as they are specified to be independent of each other).

(** The source of a dependency is a kontext label together with a

(** A scope entry is a named area in the source code, where type-definitions can be found.
    A scope is tainted, when the corresponding class contains an extends-clause.
    It is also tainted, when it contains unqualified (i.e. ".*"-style) imports. Such
    imports not fully supported, though.
    The entries of a scope_entries are the (possibly locally renamed) lexically defined entities.
